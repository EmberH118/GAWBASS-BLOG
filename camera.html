		<h1>SICK CAUGHT ON CAMERA?!
		<p>Apparently this slide show of pictures was just released by the athourities depicting two people getting violently murdered by Sick. I AM FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW!!! The mask looks so much cooler than the fbi sketch!! The victims were of yet another billionare couple, Mr. And Mrs. Smith. They owned that popular matteress company I always see on TV called "Mr. Mattress" or whatever. How does that even make you a billionaire? Capitalism is so stipid!! They must have done something because Sick showed no mercy. They were found with their spines removed, just like all of his other victims.

		These pictures were taken with the latest "Snap as you Go" technology, where every time you blink, the goggles take a picture. They're VERY expensive, so the Smiths casually bought them and went into some caves to go spulunking and stuff. They should have sat this one out, though because holy moly were they in for one hell a surprise.
