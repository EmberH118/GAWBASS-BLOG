        <h1>About me/The blog
        <p> Before I start my ramblings, heres a little bit about me. I love serial killers!!! I also love terrible slasher movies, horror theme park rides, listening to System of a Down, playing violent video games, and my favorite colors are pink and black.

        <p> Like I said before, this site is all about my favorite hyperfixation: The serial murderer known as Sick! I am obsessed with Sick. The deaths are so extremly unsual and intriguing and the police are STUMPED!! It's actually insane. No one's ever seen deaths like it. He's like Jack the Ripper or The Zodiac Killer but a thousand times cooler! The masses are scared of him and everyone on the internet is freaking out and are doing dumb challenges to "summon" him or whatever.

       <p> He's quickly becoming iconic because of who he happens to target: The Wealthy. Society is seeing on the news that billionaires are being found with missing spines - that even the rich aren't safe from this man. I'm a big fan of that, thats for sure. I could rant about how much billionaires are draining the earth of all it's resources and are gonna hide in bunkers when everything goes to shit - but instead I will give all my attention to the one person who seems to be cleaning up this issue in the first place. >:)
