		<h1> I made my own Sick mask!!!
	   <p> I finally finished making my own mask replicated from how Sick's mask looks in those Snap-As-You-Go goggle photos. I'm obsessed, I want to MEET this guy. My parents have been getting worried about me but they don't understand. They'll never understand if they keep subscribing to capitalism and worshiping billionares. My mom is so obsessed with all these actors and singers and politicians it drives me CRAZY. The rich need to PAY and their money isn't enough. Sick is making sure they pay with blood.
