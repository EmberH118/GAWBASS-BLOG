      <p> I know it's evil, but with the anonymous internet on my side, I can proudly say that I'm glad hes wiping out the rich specifically. Capitalism was a mistake. Bood will be shed. Sick represents the silent rage that the middle class and the poor harbor for the rich. The true people who make sure we have nothing. Without the middle class and the poor, there is no upper class, there is no capitailism. If Sick were to lead a movement, I'd be the first to sign up!! But he's smart for keeping a low profile though. We don't know what he looks like, and all descriptions of him revolve around a smiling mask.

<p> This is Sicks official FBI recreation, it looks so creepy and disturbing, if I was rich, I'd be terrified.
