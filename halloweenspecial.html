		<h1>Lets talk about my favorite Sick case!!
		<p> My favorite case that Sick is a suspect for is the case of Honey Winters. Honey was the daughter of Sam Winters, founder and CEO of "Sam's Meats" one of the largest bussinesses in the meat industry. Honey worked for her dad and had her own designated butchers shop that she wanted to run so I don't feel bad for her. Who WANTS to butcher cows and pigs all day? Sheesh.

		<p> She was murdered a couple of months ago by getting shot point blank range with a pump-action 12 gauge shotgun. The reason I love this case is not only because he uses a shotgun, my FAVORITE type of gun ever, but also because of the nature of the case. Honeys body was found with her spine completley missing, much like all of his other victims, but something the police was able to find was a camera within the room that was disabled at the time. The camera had a microphone on it which wasn't disabled and was able to pick up what happened in that room via audio recording.
